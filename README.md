# CANVAS PERFORMANCE SCORE

## Invisible in-browser performance test.

Runs simple draw and transform operations without interfering visually. Provides feedback for achieved frames result.

Useful for determining actual performance capabilities, rather than limited mobile vs desktop checks, which may not always be adequate.

Configurable:
- duration (fixed or ongoing until interrupted)
- load (number of objects for tests)

Provide fallback for non-WebGL environments.

### Building
```
npm i
grunt
```
